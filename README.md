# Atkal - a Romanized Sindhi programming language

This was a semester project for the **Compiler Construction** course. I implemented an **interpreter** for a programming language that uses **Romanized Sindhi syntax**. This project explores **language localization** by allowing Sindhi speakers to write code in their native language using the Roman script.  

## Features  
- Custom **Romanized Sindhi syntax** for intuitive programming.  
- **Lexical analysis, parsing, and execution** via an interpreter.  
- Supports basic programming constructs like **variables, loops, if-else, comments and string concatination**.  
- Implements standard **interpreter design techniques**.

## Usage
```.\atkal code.sd```

## Language syntax
- Variables
```
x = 1
y = 2

dekhaar x, y

z = x + y

dekhaar z
dekhaar x - y
```
